  @brief         Processing function for the Q31 FIR decimator (fast variant).
  @param[in]     S          points to an instance of the Q31 FIR decimator structure
  @param[in]     pSrc       points to the block of input data
  @param[out]    pDst       points to the block of output data
  @param[in]     blockSize  number of samples to process
  @return        none

  @par           Scaling and Overflow Behavior
                   This function is optimized for speed at the expense of fixed-point precision and overflow protection.
                   The result of each 1.31 x 1.31 multiplication is truncated to 2.30 format.
                   These intermediate results are added to a 2.30 accumulator.
                   Finally, the accumulator is saturated and converted to a 1.31 result.
                   The fast version has the same overflow behavior as the standard version and provides less precision since it discards the low 32 bits of each multiplication result.
                   In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by log2(numTaps) bits (where log2 is read as log to the base 2).

  @remark
                   Refer to \ref arm_fir_decimate_q31() for a slower implementation of this function which uses a 64-bit accumulator to provide higher precision.
                   Both the slow and the fast versions use the same instance structure.
                   Use function \ref arm_fir_decimate_init_q31() to initialize the filter structure.
