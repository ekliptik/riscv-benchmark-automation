/**
  @brief         Processing function for the Q15 FIR filter.
  @param[in]     S          points to an instance of the Q15 FIR filter structure
  @param[in]     pSrc       points to the block of input data
  @param[out]    pDst       points to the block of output data
  @param[in]     blockSize  number of samples to process
  @return        none

  @par           Scaling and Overflow Behavior
                   The function is implemented using a 64-bit internal accumulator.
                   Both coefficients and state variables are represented in 1.15 format and multiplications yield a 2.30 result.
                   The 2.30 intermediate results are accumulated in a 64-bit accumulator in 34.30 format.
                   There is no risk of internal overflow with this approach and the full precision of intermediate multiplications is preserved.
                   After all additions have been performed, the accumulator is truncated to 34.15 format by discarding low 15 bits.
                   Lastly, the accumulator is saturated to yield a result in 1.15 format.

  @remark
                   Refer to \ref arm_fir_fast_q15() for a faster but less precise implementation of this function.
